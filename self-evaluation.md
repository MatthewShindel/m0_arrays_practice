How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel confident with the amoutn of work that we've done for arrays so far. Everything makes sense, though looking at the methods available for arrays to use, there is a lot to learn about in the future.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I want to learn more about some of the useful methods that we might use in the future when we're doing more work with arrays. I learned about using the combination of arrayName.slice(-1).pop() to pull out the last element in an array without removing it from the original array, so cool piece of information like that seem really useful.

What questions do you have about Arrays?

I don't have any major questions about arrays just yet, though I imagine that they'll be more problems later on in the course as we use them more.
